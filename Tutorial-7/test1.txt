Space is a three-dimensional continuum containing positions 
and directions.[1] In classical physics, physical space is often 
conceived in three linear dimensions. Modern physicists usually 
consider it, with time, to be part of a boundless four-dimensional 
continuum known as spacetime.[2] The concept of space is considered
to be of fundamental importance to an understanding of the physical 
universe. However, disagreement continues between philosophers over 
whether it is itself an entity, a relationship between entities, or 
part of a conceptual framework.
